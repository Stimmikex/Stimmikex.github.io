# What is Ride along?

Ride along is a website that allows people to get a ride with someone who is driving from the same area and to the same area you are going.

Drivers can offer a ride by selecting where they are and where they are going. Passengers can request a ride by doing the same thing.

When a driver offers a ride he can see people that requested a ride between the same locations and click a button to accept them as a passenger.
When a driver accepts a passenger the site sends the passenger a notification where he/she can say yes or no to the driver.
If the passenger says yes to the driver he/she is notified and they will be able to send messages to each other to aggree on where exactly to meet.
